# tetrjs
Yet another simple tetris clone in the browser.

* Built using p5.js library for drawing on the canvas.
* Inspiration comes from http://farter.cn/tetr.js/

# about
* Tetris is one of my favorites I revisit from time to time. This one is just a fun little project to keep me occupied for now. I'm surprised I haven't made my own tetris clone until now.
* I am aware of the many mistakes and inaccuracies that exist in my version.
* There are many features/creature-comforts to be implemented, but are more complicated than you would first think
